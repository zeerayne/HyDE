## [Unreleased] v25.7.3

We use a dedicated Python environment to keep HyDE clean and dependency-free. Just run your scripts with `hyde-shell`— this handles the environment for you.

Examples:  
 `hyde-shell mediaplayer.py`  
 `hyde-shell waybar`

- Mediaplayer: RIght click menu for mediaplayer
- Mediaplayer: Scroll up/down to seek
- Waybar: Added a POC implementation of drawers in group modules
