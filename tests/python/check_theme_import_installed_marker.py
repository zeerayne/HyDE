"""theme.import.py's fzf list marks already-installed themes with a leading,
colored checkmark (INSTALLED_PREFIX) so "More Themes" shows what's already
there without repeating a text label on every row.

fzf's --ansi (needed to render that color at all) STRIPS the SGR escape
codes out of every value it hands back via `{}` -- both the live preview
substitution and the final selected-line output on stdout -- keeping only
the glyph. A first version of this marker stripped the wrong thing: it
matched the *colored* prefix, which fzf's `{}` never actually contains, so
every installed theme's JSON lookup silently failed and its preview (and
its confirm-time selection) broke while not-installed themes -- whose
prefix is plain spaces with nothing for --ansi to strip -- kept working.
That's the actual shape of the bug this file exists to catch: it must
assert the JSON lookup *succeeds* with fzf's real, already-stripped output,
not just that the script doesn't crash on it.
